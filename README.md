## Project Summary

This project compares the process and outputs of two different community detection methods on a newtwork graph: [Infomap](https://www.mapequation.org/infomap/) clustering and unsupervised [GaphSAGE](https://snap.stanford.edu/graphsage/) node embeddings using [t-SNE]https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/ dimensionality reduction on a homogenous, undirected network graph of scientific authorship and collaboration. It is shown that the underlying algorithms produce qualitatively different results and insights into the organization of a system.
